2.   **keep**. A dictionary that defines the *worst* hand you'll keep while mulliganing.
3.   **mulls**. A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines the cards you want to *keep* after each discard.
4.   **sims**. The number of simulations to run.
5.   **turns**. The number of turns to simulate.
